Манько Софія, Головач Лук'яна

**AutoFormula** is a Python library for automated feature analysis, evaluation and feature engineering in data analysis and ML tasks. The library is built to work with real-world, mixed-type datasets containing numerical, categorical, boolean, datetime and text features.

The **main goal** of **AutoFormula** is to provide a statistically grounded framework for answering important questions:
- Which features are useful for predicting the target?
- Which features duplicate the same information?
- Which features have a real statistical effect?
- Which feature transformations may be helpful?
